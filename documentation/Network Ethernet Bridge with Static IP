Step-by-Step Guide to Configure Static IP for Bridge br0
========================================================

Step 1: Remove Existing Configurations
======================================

  First, let's clean up any existing configurations:

sudo nmcli connection delete br0                         #make sure to replace br0 and eth0 with your device names
sudo nmcli connection delete eth0                        # use command "ip a" to get network details and device names  

Step 2: Create the Bridge and Enslave the Ethernet Interface
============================================================
   
  Create a new bridge connection named br0:

sudo nmcli connection add type bridge con-name br0 ifname br0

  Add your Ethernet interface (eth0) to the bridge:

sudo nmcli connection add type ethernet slave-type bridge con-name br0-port ifname eth0 master br0

Step 3: Configure the Bridge with a Static IP
=============================================

    Set the bridge to use a static IP address:

sudo nmcli connection modify br0 ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 10.0.0.252/24 ipv4.gateway 10.0.0.1 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"     # replace ipv4 address with desired static ip and gateway,  replace 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 with your desired DNS server
sudo nmcli connection modify br0 ipv6.method disabled

Step 4: Activate the Bridge
===========================

    Bring up the bridge connection:

sudo nmcli connection up br0

    Bring up the enslaved Ethernet interface (if it isnâ€™t brought up automatically):

sudo nmcli connection up br0-port

    Restart networking services

sudo systemctl restart networking

Verification Steps
==================
    Check the active connections:

nmcli connection show

     Ensure that br0 and br0-port are listed and that br0 is active (in green).

    Verify the bridge interface status:

ip addr show br0

    Ensure br0 has the static IP address 10.0.0.252 and is in the UP state.
