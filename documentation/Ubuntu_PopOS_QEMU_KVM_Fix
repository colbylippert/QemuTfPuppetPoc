Overview
========

SELinux is enforced by QEMU on Ubuntu distros even when disabled globally. 
This leads to the following error : "unexpected Could not open '/var/lib/libvirt/images/<FILE_NAME>': Permission denied".

Fix
===

sudo nano /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
set security_driver=none
uncomment security_driver
ctrl+s ctrl+x
sudo systemctl restart libvirtd

Summary
=======

SELinux is enforced even when disabled globally on Ubunutu Distros which denies file permissions KVM needs to run.

Uncommenting "security_driver" and setting it to none in the qemu.conf, then restarting libvirtd, fixes this.
